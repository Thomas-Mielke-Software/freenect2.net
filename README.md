Freenect2.Net
=============

A work-in-progress C# wrapper for [libfreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2).

Note this library only works with Kinect One. If you have Kinect 360, you should
use [libfreenect](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page) which comes with its own
C# wrapper (as well as many other wrappers).
